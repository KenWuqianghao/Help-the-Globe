# Help-the-Globe

A medical translation companion powered by artificial intelligence and a large language model as an autonomous agent. Our team was able to deliver advanced technology simplified through a straightforward user experience, enabling access for people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition to our fully functional software, our vision is to provide a standardized mode of delivery through MedMax kiosks and Medical Companions (MedCom) devices located throughout hospitals. ‚õëÔ∏è

In partnership with local governments and healthcare entities, MedMax empowers newcomers and Canadians facing access barriers in healthcare settings by removing the high cost of interpretation, bridging the language and medical knowledge gap in real-time, and connecting information between providers, patients, and online medical databases. ü•º
